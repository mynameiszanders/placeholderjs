[Input Autofill][2]
===================

[jQuery][4] Plugin for the automatic population of input text fields, by [Zander Baldwin][1]. It is used to replicate the HTML5 input placeholder features in modern browsers.

This is designed purely as a substitute for browsers without the HTML5 input placeholder feature, is that feature is present in the current browser, the plugin exits quietly.
